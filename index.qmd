## Outline & Learning objectives:

::: {.fragment}
- What is reproducibility and replicability?
- Why do it & how we do it?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Understand what reproducibility and replicability are
- How `quarto` can be used to create documents, web pages, in an effort to increase replicability and reproducibility 
- create your own presentation
:::

## What is Reproducibility?
::: {.fragment}
- Ability for other people *with a similar level of skill* to reproduce your work. 
- Other **people**:
  - colleagues in company, 
  - group members in a project,
  - yourself in a year when you want to use your project work for something else,
- Fundamental part of research
- Also is best practice - which will allow others to reproduce your work. 
:::

## Sometimes we get confused into the terminology...
::: {.fragment}
*"\[...\] when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset
\[...\] produce the same answer."* ([Turing
Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions))

:::


## Why we need Reproducibility?
::: {.fragment}
- We need to have confidence that our research is good quality and we are doing good science

- Peter Fisher (1993) compared seven different pieces of GIS software doing a viewshed analysis

- and got seven (slightly) different results!
:::


![](images/fisher-1993-fig8.png)


## Why do it?

- Fisher also discovered a major error in one piece of software which gave completely incorrect results.

- Highlights the need for:

  - Standards & testing to make sure this doesn't happen
  - Algorithms used to be published so people can see what is happening
  - Issues when only binary files are available, and not the source code

Fisher, P. F. (1993). Algorithm and implementation uncertainty in viewshed analysis. International Journal of Geographical Information Systems, 7(4), 331–347. https://doi.org/10.1080/02693799308901965




## Why do it?
- Standards & testing to make sure this doesn't happen
  
- Algorithms used to be published so people can see what is happening
  - Publish algorithms in journals
  - Even more important with machine learning - transparency is important
  
- Issues when only binary files are available, and not the source code
  - Growth in open source software - so you can see (and unpick) what is happening


## Research
::: {.fragment}
- Some journals & conferences ask you to submit code along with your paper

- AGILE - https://reproducible-agile.github.io/

- Anyone (with a similar level of skills) should be able to do reproduce your research and benefit from it. 

- One reason for open source tools.
	
- If you do analysis in ArcGIS Pro, you need ArcGIS Pro to recreate that analysis. 
	
- If you don't have ArcGIS Pro, what do you do?
:::


## How do we do this?
::: {.fragment}
- Documenting what you did is standard - Methods

- If you can do what you did in a script, then you can also share this

- ArcGIS Pro / QGIS
  - graphical interface, click buttons, etc
  
- R / Python
  - write out the script
:::


## Setup - "environments"
::: {.fragment}
- To replicate a piece of work, you need to know what software they used

- What version?

- Which libraries / packages?

- What version of libraries or packages?
:::  


## Writing, Presentations
::: {.fragment}
Also works for writing and presentations as well.

- Markdown allows you to write plain text with tags - stars, hashes, etc.

- Can also do analysis in this

- LaTeX is a developed version of Markdown (or Markdown is a simple version of LaTeX)

- RMarkdown allows you to run R code

- Quarto allows you to run other code (Python, R, etc.)

- This presentation is written in Quarto  :smile:

## Let's dive into Quarto
-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a new, open-source, scientific and
    technical publishing system
-  Combine text and code to produce formatted documents
-   Publish reproducible and dynamic presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books
    in HTML, PDF, MS Word, etc.
-   Multi-language support for R, Python, Julia, and more
-   Quarto extends [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and
    shares similarities with [Juypter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

## Formats

- **Documents**: HTML, PDF, MS Word, Open Office, ePub
- **Presentations**: Revealjs, PowerPoint, 
- **Wikis**: MediaWiki, JiraWiki, ...
- Many templates exist for academic documents: [quarto-journals](https://github.com/quarto-journals/)
- And much more: Jupyter, RTF, InDesign, ...


## How does Quarto work?

## How does Quarto handle code chunks?
- example with the iris dataset (flowers)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data(iris)

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, 
     main = "Scatter Plot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width",
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
     pch = 16, col = iris$Species)

```


## Plots

````{.markdown}
```{{r}}
#| label: "iris-plot"
#| echo: TRUE
#| fig-format: svg
#| cache: TRUEs

data(iris)

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, 
     main = "Scatter Plot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width",
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
     pch = 16, col = iris$Species)

```

````
defaults to *knitr* engine (you can override the engine with `engine: jupyter`)


````{.markdown}
```{{python}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
````

## Air Quality
@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```


## Population density map in PA, 2010
- code was run in a markdown, and image saved
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pa_population_density_map.png")
```

## Key Benefit: (Explicit) Version Control {{< fa code-compare >}}

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}

- Going back through time
- Great for collaboration
- Allow sharing and adaptation
  - Just like [this presentation](https://github.com/nickbearman/reproducibility-replicability-gds-penn)
- Allows automation

### Practice what you preach!

By setting up your teaching materials in a reproducible manner, you demonstrate the value of reproducibility directly

- Useful for others
- Useful for future you when you teach this course again
